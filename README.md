üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @EnzisZero
- I'm a Software Engineer in Colorado in the United States. I've been writing code for 10+ years, using C++ and Python, in conjunction with various database applications. In my free time, I've written various websites and maintain my own server for fun, using virtualization and containers.
- The best code is maintainable code. It doesn't matter how fancy something is if the next person can work with it. In addition, no one should be a single point of failure. All development work should be well documented and done with the intention of passing it on.

‚úàÔ∏è My professional interests
- My favorite skill is developer acceleration, done through clean processes and automation. Strong and effective development relies on a supportive environment.
- A clean DevOps/DevSecOps is important for automating the process of code checked in to high quality deliveries.
- I enjoy mentorship and helping junior engineers grow in their career.
